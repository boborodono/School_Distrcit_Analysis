# School District Analysis

An analysis of a local school district's data.

## Overview of School District Analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
 The purpose of this analysis is to help Maria and her supervisor get a better understanding of the current state of the school district after removing all ninth grade math and reading test scores from Thomas High School.

## School District Analysis Results: 

### 1. How is the district summary affected?

<br/>
After removing Thomas High School ninth grade test scores from the district the end result did not change much. 
<br/>
While average reading scores did not change, average math scores lowered by a tenth of a point. The percentage of students that passed reading and math lowered by .1 and .2 points, respectively and the Overall Passing Percentage lowered by .3 points. 
<br/>
While we believe it was necessary to remove an entire grade's test scores from THS due to suspected academic dishonesty we don't find the updated results of the reanalyzed district to be significantly different.

<br/>

The removed test grades did not move the needle on THS's overall performance. As you can see from the two images above... 
- When rounded to the tenths place, average reading and math scores did not change. 
- When rounded to the integer, the average percentage of students that passed reading, math, and the overall passing percentage did not change.

### 3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

<br/>
Because of the very small difference in THS's test scores after removing it's ninth grade cohorts' results, Thomas High School's position within the district remains unchanged. You can see the miniscule score changes more clearly in the two images above as we have extended the test score values out to the millionths place.

### 4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

I have saved you the trouble of trying to determine the difference between two identical tables. All of the above images were exactly the same between the two analyses. There was no significant difference between the scores by
